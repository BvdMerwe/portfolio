My friends call me Bernie - I'm a frontend developer by day, and an aspiring code god by night.  

I'm currently professionally focused on frontend development, but my skills don't end there. When I have free time, I like to tinker with hardware (arduino/micropython), backend development (supabase), systems development (rust), 3D printing, design, poetry and music. I've recompiled my 3D printer's firmware too many times to count at this point.  

I have an incurable curiosity for technology and a passion for building things that people like using.
