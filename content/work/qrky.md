[QRky.app](https://qrky.app){target="_blank"} is a QR Code Creation platform for everyone that boasts URL shortening and visitor tracking to ensure your traffic ends up in the right place.

While I was on an extended vacation I needed something to keep my hands busy, so I started getting to work. By using Supabase, [DaisyUI](https://daisyuikit.com/){target="_blank" noreferer noopener} and NextJS I was able to move quickly and get a working MVP up and running in less than 5 days.

### Challenges
I used this project as an excuse to learn how Supabase works, as well as something that could integrate into my other projects. I also gave myself a short timeline so that I could start and finish this while I was on vacation.
