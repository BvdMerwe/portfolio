I was tasked to build a uniform sign-up experience that can be reused across multiple product sites and multiple domains.

We developed a single VueJS package that could be imported into any of our NuxtJS based landing pages and apps. This package is completely configurable to cater the specific product, theme, and flow it is placed within.

### Challenges
With a large variety of different product offerings and sign up flows, it was challenging to make them all responsive and easy to use across every device. Another challenge was that many of the APIs this form interacted varied significantly, which required a great deal of collaboration across different teams.

### Impact
- **An uptake** in user sign-ups due to the ease of use, and not having to redirect to a customer portal. 
- A more **consistent and smooth experience** for the customers fostered a sense of brand trust.
