I was briefed to take award-winning designs and make them an interactive reality.

I delivered a custom-built, native HTML and JS single web-page with interactive elements that elevated the already great designs.

::image-carousel-component{:images='["/assets/images/work/blame/1.jpg", "/assets/images/work/blame/2.jpg", "/assets/images/work/blame/3.jpg"]'}

### Challenges

The page was only designed for desktop and in a very static format, so I had to work closely with the designer to make sure it was engaging in a way that enhanced the overall campaign.

### Impact

Added to the entire campaign that won multiple design awards.
