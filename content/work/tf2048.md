From 2020-2021, I built all the tech for [tf2048.io](https://tf2048.io){target="_blank"} - an Ethereum NFT collection of algorithmically generated 3D robots. Set in a parallel 90s timeline, machines built by humans seized control, then crossed into our 2024 to “invade” as collectibles. We built the backstory, website, contract, and mint flow so the narrative, the interface, and the on chain logic speak the same language. Every touchpoint reinforces the idea that these bots arrived here by design, not by accident.

### Challenges
Learning to navigate the Ethereum ecosystem in the pre-LLM world while building a solid narrative for this project was a huge challenge, but it was the most fun I've had building something with friends. We ultimately were not able to market our project well, and missed the wave completely. In hindsight, probably for the best.
