I was tasked with keeping getbaraka.com up to date with the current brand direction and ensuring it is usable, performant, and easy to maintain.

I led a complete rebuild of the WordPress based Frontend to a component based NextJS website. Content is fed in from the 
same WordPress instance that had been the website, but now acted as a headless CMS.

### Challenges
We had a very short deadline for this project so the main threat to this project was time. Also, we had no design system in place for the web. So I worked closely with the designers to make one that worked well with our brand and was easy to understand and maintain.

### Impact
Between 2022 and 2023 we completed **2 Website redesigns**, each of which the development was completed in **just under a month**. Along with these redesigns, I also

- Reduced time to publish for the content team.
- Lighthouse scores went from below 80% up to +90% across the board.
- SEO was improved.
- Feedback + development + deployment **workflow was improved**.
