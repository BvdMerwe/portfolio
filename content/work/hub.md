I was tasked with taking over and applying a redesign of our back-office administration dashboard.

I created custom components that align with the new design, which was based on internal research identifying team struggles. To keep timelines short, I reused the existing component library, and added custom CSS and business logic to align it to the desired designs.

In cases where components did not exist, they were created from scratch for that specific task.

### Challenges

The platform was lacking a lot of documentation and there were parts missing from the new designs. This came up during testing and after launch where I had to make several last minute additions. This was a good challenge as I had to work closely with our customer service agents to tend to their needs and build out parts that were needed.

### Impact
The UI was originally cluttered and everything was loaded on a single page with hard to navigate tabs and lacking a consistent design language. I helped standardise the design and build reusable components that helped in speed of creating new features. The enhanced app also helped:

- Customer service and operations teams are able to process and screen new customers faster.
- Customer information is easier to find.
- Customer problems are easier to diagnose and resolve.
