challenges: The platform was lacking a lot of documentation and there were parts missing from the new designs. This came up during testing as well as after launch where I had to make quite a few last minute additions. This was a good challenge as I had to work closely with our customer service agents to tend to their needs and build out parts that were needed.

I was tasked with taking over and applying a redesign of our back-office administration dashboard.

Create custom components that align with the new design that was based on internal research to see what the team was struggling with. To keep timelines short, I reused the component library that had been installed, and added custom CSS that would align it to the desired designs.

In cases where components did not exist, they were created from scratch for that specific task.
