I was responsible for building unique NuxtJS pages with custom components and designs for each unique product that Afrihost offers. These pages are deployed on bare metal servers via Laravel Forge.

### Challenges
The designs for each product were unique and required a new approach for each build. This made it challenging to reuse components, but I worked closely with the design and UX team to extract all reusable colours, styles and components to make it easier to deploy.

### Impact
An increase in user sign-ups during campaign periods.
Better customer trust for specific demographics.
