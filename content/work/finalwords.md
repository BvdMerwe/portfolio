Some close friends got together and thought of a way to remember their lost loved ones, [Final Words](https://finalwords.uk){target="_blank"} was the answer. A platform to remember those you love, built by a family that want to cherish their own lost loved ones.

I built and maintained this platform from 2024-2025. Initially I was the sole developer on this project and onboarded a friend to help out with delivering new features.

### Challenges
This was the first time I had worked with Laravel Livewire, Stripe integrations and building a fully blown e-commerce website from scratch - so it was an interesting journey to go from zero to hero. 

### Impact
Built an MVP in less than a month, and rapidly moved to a working product that we were happy with.
