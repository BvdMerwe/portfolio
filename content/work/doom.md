I was part of the development team that showcased the entire DOOM product range in an engaging way.

We developed a self-hosted WordPress site that served as a headless CMS paired with a frontend built in Angular 2. We ensured that content creators could easily keep content up-to-date in a straightforward, and well-known interface.

### Challenges

This was my first project working with any reactive frontend framework in a professional setting. I had to learn fast to make sure we could hit deadlines, which we did.

### Impact

This effort resulted in an award-winning design brought to life.
