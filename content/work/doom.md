I was part of the development team that helped display the entire doom product range in an interesting way that is also easy to manage and keep content up-to-date.

We built a self-hosted WordPress site that acted as a headless CMS paired with a frontend built in Angular 2.

### Challenges

This was my first project working with AngularJS, before I had only test driven VueJS. I had to learn fast to make sure we could hit deadlines, which we did.

### Impact

An award-winning design brought to life.
