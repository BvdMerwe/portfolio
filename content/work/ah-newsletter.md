I was challenged by the design team to modernize our newsletters and transactional emails. The designs were directly modeled after our main web page designs and made to look better than any other ISPs emails.

### Challenges
Mail clients are inherently challenging to work with, so we had to do extensive testing and iteration to ensure that our modern designs were working correctly on as many popular email clients as possible. Additionally, we had to ensure that we didn't exceed strict, self-imposed file size limits. This required a very intentional and strategic use of images.

### Impact
We elevated newsletters and transactional emails to fit within the company brand, ensuring they appeared modern while maintaining email standards.
