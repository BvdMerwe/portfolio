### Challenges
So we made a VueJS package that could be imported into any of our NuxtJS based landing pages and apps. This package is completely configurable to cater the specific product, theme, and flow it is placed within.

### Impact
Mail clients are inherently challenging to work with so we had to do a lot of testing and iteration to get our modern designs working correctly on as many common email clients as possible, We also had to make sure that we werenâ€™t exceeding self imposed file size limits so images had to be used intentionally.
