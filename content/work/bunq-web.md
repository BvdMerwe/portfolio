I had to build unique NuxtJS pages with custom components & designs for each unique product that Afrihost offers. These pages are deployed on bare metal servers via Laravel Forge.

### Challenges
The designs for teach product was very unique and required a new approach with each build. This made it hard to reuse components, but we worked closely with the design and UX team to extract all reusable colours, styles and components to make it easier to deploy.

### Impact
An uptake in user sign ups during campaign periods.
Better customer trust for specific demographics.
