I was tasked with taking the incomplete newsletter platform and push it over the finish line. Beyond that, my job was to maintain the platform to allow the internal content team to deliver a high quality daily newsletter, and also provide any visual updates that will keep daily communications in line with our brand.

A single development sprint that was completed in 1 month to test and complete the full-stack platform. This included an emergency pivot to a different email delivery service just after the sprint was concluded.

### Challenges
This project was started and abandoned without any documentation, so it was a huge challenge to get off the ground and sculpt it into something that was usable.

### Impact

The content team was very happy that we could now accommodate their requests for custom features.

- The content team has more freedom to create a more informative newsletter.
- Internal UX issues are resolved faster than before.
- Over 2022 and 2023 I completed 3 newsletter rebrands and restructures.
