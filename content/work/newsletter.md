challenges: We had a very short deadline for this project so the main threat to this project was time. Also, at the time we had no design system in place for the web, so I worked closely with the designers to make one that worked well with our brand and was easy to understand and implement.

I was tasked with taking the incomplete newsletter platform and push it over the finish line. Beyond that, my job was to maintain the platform to allow the internal content team to deliver a high quality daily newsletter, and also provide any visual updates that will keep daily communications in line with our brand.

A single development sprint that was completed in 1 month to test and complete the full-stack platform. This included an emergency pivot to a different email delivery API just after the sprint was concluded.
