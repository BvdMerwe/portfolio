TBWA is an international advertising agency that works with major brands. Their goal is to make brands part of cultural phenomena and keep these brands top of mind in the general populace.

I was a part of the digital team that delivered ad assets for 5 major brands in South Africa. I helped build an innovation hub where we encouraged creatives to think outside the box and develop their digital ideas.
